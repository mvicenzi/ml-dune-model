class APASparseShardedDataset(IterableDataset):
    """
    IterableDataset over pre-sharded HDF5 files produced by loader/create_shards.py.

    Each shard holds ~shard_size samples in a flat layout (/coords, /features,
    /offsets, plus whatever truth tiers the shards were created with).  At
    training time a shuffle buffer spanning multiple shards approximates
    per-epoch reshuffling while keeping IO to one file read per buffer-refill
    step.

    Event-level truth is returned automatically when the shards carry it.
    Per-pixel tiers are opt-in (return_pixel_truth / return_extra_truth,
    same API as APASparseMetaDataset / APAPackedDataset) because HDF5
    datasets present in a shard are decompressed on every read — training
    should leave them off even on full-truth shard sets.

    Each item yielded is a tuple (voxels, meta):
        voxels: batched Voxels of exactly batch_size samples
        meta:   dict in the same format as voxels_meta_collate_fn:
                    label/nu_pdg/nu_ccnc/nu_intType → LongTensor[B]
                    nu_energy                       → FloatTensor[B]
                    vertex_xyz                      → FloatTensor[B, 3]
                    event_key                       → list[str]
                    pixel_labels / pixel_*          → list of B np.ndarray[N_i]
                {} when the shards carry no truth datasets (legacy reco shards).

    Use with DataLoader(batch_size=None, ...) to disable PyTorch auto-batching.
    Training loops that only need pixels just unpack and drop the meta.

    shuffle=True  (training):    shard order reshuffled each epoch + buffer
                                 shuffle; samples dropped into random batches.
    shuffle=False (diagnostics): deterministic shard order (sorted) and
                                 in-shard sample order — identical event
                                 sequence on every pass, e.g. for comparing
                                 features across checkpoints.

    With num_workers > 0 the shard list is split round-robin across workers so
    every sample is seen exactly once per epoch and workers never duplicate work.

    Under DDP (world_size > 1) the split is over `world_size * num_workers`
    readers instead, so ranks do not read each other's shards. That path also
    equalises the work: DDP's gradient all-reduce is a collective, so a rank
    that runs out of batches early leaves the others blocked in it. See
    `_ddp_shards` for how equal batch counts are guaranteed.
    Each worker maintains its own independent buffer.

    Samples that don't fill a complete final batch are dropped (implicit drop_last).

    Attributes:
        apa  (int|None):  APA number from metadata.json (None if absent).
        view (str|None):  wire-plane view from metadata.json (None if absent).
